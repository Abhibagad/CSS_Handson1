   <h2 class="h2">What is CSS?</h2>
   <ol class="list">
    <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Css describes how HTML elements are to be display on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
    <br />
    <li><span class="para3">Css is not neccesary</span> <span class="para4">CSS sabves a lot of work.</span><span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</span></li>
    <br />
    <li class="para5">External stylesheets are stored in css files.</li>
   </ol>
   

   <h2 class="h2">CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways:</h2>

   <ul class="list1">
    <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
    <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
    <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
    <li>The most common way to add CSS., is to keep the style s in external CSS files. However, <span class="para4">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
   </ul>
   
   <p class="para6">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS applies a style to multiple element.ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique elemrnt. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
   
   <p class="para6">In CSS,selection are used to target a specific element or range of element on a web page.Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of style can be applied to the element.</p>
  
   <p class="para6">There is a wide range of selection available. TWO of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target element to which a style should be applied.</p>
